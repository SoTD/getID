getID - "get item id by name"
Version: 0.1

Description:
"getID" is my first plugin for bukkit. If you input an item name, it outputs the corresponding item ID. I wrote this plugin mostly to get into bukkit development and to improve my java programming-skill. And yet, it's helpful for me and maybe for you sometimes. I remember many times i thought "damn what was the id for this item again.."..so you maybe give it a try.

Usage:
Put "getID.jar" in your server's /plugin/ directory.
To get an item ID: /getid item name
Example: /getid stone, /getid pink dye

Permissions:
If you want to use permissions, use this node:
getid.id

To-Do:
-Improve used regular expressions
-Dynamically item/id-list

Bugs:
none known
Changelog:
initial release - 17.05.2011
